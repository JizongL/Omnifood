## Introduction 

[Omnifood](https://jizongl.github.io/Omnifood/) is a fictionary resturant site, it is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. The main reason I did this exercise is to improve my css and html skill, also review some of my jQuery knowledge. Special thank to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/) who provided such an amazing [course](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3) on CSS and HTML. 

The live link is published as github page [Omnifood](https://jizongl.github.io/Omnifood/)

Since this is an imaginary project, the form submission is not functional.
